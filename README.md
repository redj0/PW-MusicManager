# PW-MusicManager

PW-MusicManager allows you to import wem audio files and replace the music within Pistol Whip whilst tracking the current changes.

It can be used whilst Pistol Whip is running

Features:
* Import premade Wem files
* Replace Music within game
* Makes backups of original files to allow rollback

Possible upcoming features:
* Persistant tracking of replaced songs after program close

## Installation

Grab the latest version from releases or alternatively compile yourself!

## Notes
If you start a song with a corrupted wem or a wem that the game cannot read, Pistol Whip will stop you moving in the stage and crash.

Imports/Backups are stored at $USERDIR\Documents\PW-MusicManager\


## Creating Wems
I attempted to integrate this into the program but failed miserably due to WEM being a proprietary format.
